									<p>Slicing and indexing are two fundamental concepts in Python. They help you access specific elements in a sequence, such as a list, tuple or string.

By using these techniques, you can extract substrings from strings, filter lists, and extract columns from 2D lists, among other things.

Understanding how to use slicing and indexing is essential for working with data in Python, so let's explore these concepts in detail and provide real-life examples to help you understand how they work.</p>
